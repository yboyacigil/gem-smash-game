Gem Smash Game
==============
Gem Smash Game is a android replica of the gameboy game: "Super Gem Smash Advanced" which i used to play a lot.

The game is very simple, you collect gems in the same color into a basket.Then, you push collected gems into the
appropriate column to make at least three adjacent gems vertically, on that, all adjacent gems in the same color
are smashed. By doing that you try to keep the board open otherwise game is over.

The project contains an engine & an android application:

Gem Smash Engine
----------------
Implements the game logic. It can be used independently from the android app.

Gem Smash App
-------------
Implements the game ui. Depends on engine.

The app is not complete but playable. Here are the improvements:
- Scoring is not implemented.  
- Game continues till you get bored up, levelling not supported.
- Adding sound would be good!
- Basket image needs to be better. (resolution)
